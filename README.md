## Description
Roastd is an app where coffee lovers can share, discover, and rate drinks from local coffee shops and coffee roasters. Users are able to check in and rate different drinks and review beans they purchased from coffee roasters across the nation.

Roastd gains insight from coffee drinkers with similar palettes and uses collaborative filtering to recommend certain drinks or beans to users based on their ratings or review history. The app also allows coffee shop owners and coffee roasters to directly engage with their customers and the local community.
